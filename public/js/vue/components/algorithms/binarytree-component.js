    <h1>Binary Tree Implementation </h1>
    <h3>Notable Features </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The number of nodes in a binary tree of depth n is precisely 2^n - 1.</li>
        <li>In a binary tree, the worst search time is O(n), best is O(log_2 (n)) which is a perfectly balanced tree.</li>
        <li>Average runtime is somewhere between those two.</li>
        <li>Left of node is lesser than parent.  Right is greater.</li>
        <li>To find element that is less than a parent go left, greater than, go right.</li>
        <li> </li>
